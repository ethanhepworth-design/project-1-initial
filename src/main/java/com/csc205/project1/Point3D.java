/**
 * Represents a point in three-dimensional Cartesian space.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the coordinates (x, y, z) of a point and provides
 * utility methods for common geometric operations such as distance calculation,
 * rotation, and vector operations.
 * 
 * Design Patterns and Principles:
 * 
 * 1. VALUE OBJECT PATTERN: This class represents an immutable value object where
 *    the state (x, y, z coordinates) is set at construction and cannot be modified.
 *    Operations that would "change" the point instead return new Point3D instances.
 *    This ensures thread-safety and predictable behavior.
 * 
 * 2. ENCAPSULATION: The coordinates are stored as private final fields, accessible
 *    only through getter methods. This prevents external modification and maintains
 *    data integrity.
 * 
 * 3. FLUENT INTERFACE (partial): Methods return Point3D objects, allowing for
 *    method chaining in some contexts.
 * 
 * Algorithmic Foundations:
 * 
 * - Distance calculations use the Euclidean distance formula (Pythagorean theorem
 *   in 3D space), demonstrating fundamental geometric algorithms with O(1) complexity.
 * 
 * - Rotation operations use rotation matrices from linear algebra, showing how
 *   matrix transformations apply to spatial data structures.
 * 
 * - The class serves as a building block for more complex spatial data structures
 *   like octrees, k-d trees, or point clouds used in computational geometry.
